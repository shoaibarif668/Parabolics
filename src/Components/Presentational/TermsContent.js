                    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
                    <p>Parabolics is not obligated to investigate, monitor, mediate or resolve any dispute you may have
                        with another user of the Services, although we may undertake such action in our own discretion.
                        In the event of a dispute with another User of the Services, you agree (a) to indemnify us from
                        any liability and (b) that we will not be liable, for any type of damages or for any type of
                        claim or demand arising out of or related to any dispute you may have with any other User of the
                        Services.</p>
                    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
                    <p>These Terms constitute the legal agreement between You and Parabolics and govern Your use of the
                        offering, but without prejudice to any additional Terms which may be part of an agreement
                        specific to the Services You wish to avail of (but excluding any offering which Parabolics may
                        provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements
                        between You and Parabolics in relation to the offering.</p>
                    <p>If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision
                        of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting
                        the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and
                        enforceable.</p>
                    <p>You agree that if a dispute arises between You and Parabolics, We will seek to resolve the
                        dispute as quickly as commercially reasonable. Before resorting to legal proceedings, You must
                        first contact us directly and work with us to resolve the dispute. If a dispute cannot be
                        resolved, such dispute will be referred to binding mediation between the parties, and the
                        decision of the mediation shall be final and binding to both the parties. In the event that the
                        mediation fails to yield a result, the parties shall compulsorily refer the dispute to
                        arbitration, with the arbitral panel consisting of three arbitrators; one arbitrator is chosen
                        by each party and the third being jointly appointed by the two chosen arbitrators.</p>
                    <p>

                        the courts of California for any cause of action arising out of or relating to the Services, or
                        these Terms of Use.
